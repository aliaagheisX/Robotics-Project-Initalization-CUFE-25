## Tutorials on Material

## Packages you will need

1. gmapping (for mapping in SLAM) (**Take Care :** work best for long laser radars and bad for short ones
2. explore_light (for creating map autonomously ) (launch it after launching gmapping)
3. acml (for navigation to the goal from initial position)

## Tips

### using Translate instead of VPN
I don't why but *wiki.ros.org* work poorly and slow. I found that translating it to english 3ady and then follow link will be faster
